//
//WAYS OF CREATING ARRAYS///////////////////
//
//The most common way of declaring an array is through the square brackets
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers);
//
//When you insert a single number in new Array() method, what you've just done is to define the length that the array should have..
//More than one element will result in a normal array having the inserted elements..
// I think you can also ommit the new keyword...yes you can! I Just confirmed ðŸ˜…
const moreNumbers = Array('Juma', 23);
console.log(moreNumbers);
//
// Yeah, there's also Array.of() method of creating an array ðŸ˜‚
const yetMoreNumbers = Array.of(1, 2, 4, 'Juma');
console.log(yetMoreNumbers);
//
//Array.from() is useful in converting iterables like Nodelist & array-like objects to arrays...
//Array-like object is an official term in javascript
//Consider the following example:
const list = document.querySelectorAll('li');
//
//list at this level/point is a nodelist, an array-like object, and so through Array.from() method you can convert it to become an array, meaning from aside from indexing, you can apply other methods that array has to offer like splice() method, slice() method and so on...
console.log(list);

const muchMoreNumbers = Array.from(list);
console.log(muchMoreNumbers);

//
//ARRAY METHODS///////////////////////
//
//push() method adds an item/element at the end of the array
//You can also add multiple element through push, by inserting multiple elements ðŸ˜‰
const hobbies = ['Studying', 'Praying', 'Cooking', 'Working', 'Tutoring'];
hobbies.push('Walking');
console.log(hobbies);
//
//pop() removes the last item/element of the array...
hobbies.pop();
console.log(hobbies);
//
//unshift() adds an element at the beginning of an array..
//It's called unshift because it shifts to the right all the items in the array in order to add an element at the beginning of the array...
hobbies.unshift('Teaching');
console.log(hobbies);
//
//shift() methods removes an element at the beginning of an array...
//This happens because the shift(), as the name suggests, shifts the items to the left and thus removes an item at the beginning...
hobbies.shift();
console.log(hobbies);
//
//The splice() can be used for various purposes, primarily to delete an item OR items fron an array...
//For deleting an item/items you begin by defining where you want splice to check from. So, the first argument is telling splce fro which index it should start cheking, the second item is the number of items states the number of items to be removed, starting from that item...
hobbies.splice(1, 1, 'Loving');
console.log(hobbies);
//
//When you use the negative sign, especially for the first element, this means that splice will begin to check from the right-side of the array
hobbies.splice(-2, 1);
console.log(hobbies);
//
//the slice() method is handy, first of all for copying arrays...
//Arrays are in the end objects, and therefore are reference values..
//So in reassigning an array to another constant/variable, the constant/variable will only point to the address of that array in memory...
//that's where the slice() method becomes useful, for RETURNING NEW ARRAYS..
//Consider teh following use-case:
const testResults = [1, 5.3, 1.5, 10.99, 'Jesus', -5, 10];
//
//Without the slice(), if I try to push anything on testResults array, storedResults would be affected...
//But with the slice() method, a brand new array, with different address in memory is created
const storedResults = testResults.slice();

testResults.push(5.78);

console.log(storedResults, testResults);
//
//However, this is not the only purpose of the slice() method, so let's examine some more...
//slce() method can be useful in creating ranges in an array...when you want certain items of the array, and not the whole array..
//So in this example, the first argument is the index of where you want to start from, then the second argument is the index you want to stop at..
//The item at the first index is included in that range while the last one is not..
const range = testResults.slice(1, 4);
console.log(range);

//Also, you can use negative index, but both have to be negative, and also the second argument should always be greater than the first
const negativeIndices = testResults.slice(-7, -4);
console.log(negativeIndices);
// Also, as a side note, when you insert a single element, slice() will start looking at that speified index, until the end
//
//the concat() method is used to extract items of an array, and add them to aan existing array..
//It returns a brand new array, which makes it more useful
const concatArray = [23, 25, 'Jesus', 'is', 'LORD'];
//Or you can smply insert the array directly inside the concat method
const concated = testResults.concat(concatArray);
console.log(concated);
//
//IndexOf() & lastIndexOf() methods are used, as their names suggest, to find the index of the item that is passed as an argument
//they return -1 if the item is not found/isn't present
const fourthValue = testResults.indexOf(10.99);
console.log(fourthValue);
//
//lastIndexOf() begins looking from the right-side of the array..
console.log(concated.lastIndexOf('Jesus'));
//
//However, when having reference values like objects in an array, indexOf() & lastIndexOf() methods may not be up to the task, in looking for the indices...
//This is because in trying to find the reference value, like for instance an object, it'll returns -1, which means that it didn'd find anything. This happens since while inserting the exact object as an argument in the indexOf() OR lastIndexOf() methods, you explicitly create another new object entirely, in a new address in memory....
const personData = [{ firstName: 'Juma' }, { lastName: 'Frank' }];
console.log(personData.indexOf({ lastName: 'Frank' }));
//
//To solve this issue with reference values, javascript has anotehr array method called the find() method...
//the find() method takes a function as an argument, usually it's an anonymous function unless you want to reuse it again and so reference it with the function...
//So it takeas another function as an argument, then that function that is passed takes a maximum of 3 arguments, i.e the single item, the index of that item AND the full array...
//Assuming we want to obtain the lastName object in our personData array:
const juma = personData.find((name, idx, names) => {
  //find() method has to return a boolean, which returns true for that item we're looking for, and false for the rest of the items
  return name.firstName === 'Juma';
});

console.log(juma);
//
//As the name says, findIndex() method searches the entire array and finds the index of the item, it's looking for...and of course you can use the index as you wish
const frankIndex = personData.findIndex((person, idx, persons) => {
  return person.lastName === 'Frank';
});

console.log(frankIndex);
